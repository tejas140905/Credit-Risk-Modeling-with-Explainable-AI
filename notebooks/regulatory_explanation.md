        **Why Explainability is Critical in Banking (Regulatory Compliance)**
        
        1. **Fair Lending (ECOA/Reg B):** Banks must prove their models don't discriminate based on protected classes (race, gender, age).
        2. **Adverse Action Notices:** When a loan is denied, the bank is legally required to provide specific "reason codes" explaining why (e.g., "debt-to-income ratio too high").
        3. **Model Risk Management (SR 11-7):** Regulators require deep understanding of how models work, their limitations, and their impact on business decisions.
        4. **Transparency & Trust:** Customers and internal stakeholders need to trust the model's output before it can be deployed in production.
